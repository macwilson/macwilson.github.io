      <p>AntiFreeze is a project designed to detect freezing of gait in Parkinson's patients and apply a stimulus that allows them to continue walking.</p>
      <p>I focussed mostly on designing, building and maintaining the circuit that connects an accelerometer and a motor to a microcontroller, which allows the detection of "shuffling" before freezing begins as well as the application of the vibrating stimulus.</p>
      <p>I also assisted with freezing of gait data collection and analysis in Matlab in order to generate framework concepts for the signal processing algorithm, which was eventually written in C for the microcontroller, as well as report writing, research, and presentation for the final solution.</p>

      <h4>Furniture Refurbishing and Design:</h4>

      <img src="img/drawer.png" alt="Photo of the first set of drawers I made"/>
      
      <p>Furniture design/construction is a side hobby of mine that started with the drawers above and continues today - I often see if I can build a piece of furniture instead of buying it. These projects save me money, bring me pleasure, and allow me to get creative in an unusual way. I pride myself on the small details of a piece, such as routered designs in the door, selection of the right hardware, or tiny designs on drawer legs created with a lathe.<p>
      <p>The set of drawers above was refurbished from a broken, discarded set from the 1960s. I aimed to preserve or improve original details while fixing broken components and revamping the overall style. I later constructed a set of shelves in a matching design from scratch.</p>
      <p>Most recently I constructed a desk from a discarded wooden door with several matching shelving units built from scratch.</p>
      
      <p id="skills">Skills Used: Design sketching, creativity, machining (notable tools: drill press, band saw, circular saw, lathe, sander, router)</p>

"Co-integrating thermal and hemodynamic imaging for physiological monitoring," Journal of Computational Vision and Imaging Systems, 2 October 2016. <a href="http://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/vsl/article/view/111/97" target="_blank">Read it here!</a></br></br>ABSTRACT: Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) has gained popularity for non-intrusive cardiovascular monitoring. However, certain symptoms (e.g., fever) may not be easily detectable using cardiovascular biomarkers. Here, we investigate the co-integration of PPGI and thermal imaging to create a non-contact, widefield, multimodal physiological monitoring system. To achieve strong PPGI performance, high-power infrared LED stability was investigated by evaluating two LED driver boards. Results show that the multimodal imaging system was able to acquire spatially consistent hemodynamic pulsatility and heat distributions in a case study. This multimodal system may lead to improved systemic disease detection and monitoring.</li>
